This folder is reserved for How To Play media (screenshots and videos).

Suggested organization:
- lobby-*.png — room creation / lobby screens
- board-*.png — board and player mat overviews
- cards-*.png — card close-ups and type explanations
- hand-*.png — hand layout, end turn flow
- winner-*.png — winner screen and recap views

You can import or reference these assets from `frontend/src/pages/HowToPlay.tsx`
once they are added. For now, the page renders textual content and generic
placeholders indicating where media will appear.
